1. What is Java?
 Ans: It is a high level programing language used for backend development.

2. What is JDK, JRE, JVM?
 Ans: * JDK is a Java development kit in which we can write code and compile it and run and we can also debug code and it also has inbuild libraries.
     * JRE means Java Runtime Environment it is required to run java code.
     * JVM means Java Virtual Machine means it is used to convert our code into machine code.

3. How to write a Java program? and how to compile it?
 Ans: * First create a file like Filename.java
     * Write a class with the same filename u had created.
        ex: public class Filename{}
     * Write the main method inside it
        ex: public static void main(String[] args){}
     * After creating main method write your logic inside the main method
        ex : The total code looks like this
            public class Filename{
                public static void main(String[] args){
                    System.out.println("Write Your Logic Here");
                }
            }
     * For compilation use terminal cmd : javac Filename.java
     * For Running the code use terminal cmd : java Filename
     * First we need to compile the code and then run till we make changes we can run if we make changes we should compile it again and run.

4. Why only 1 class file is allowed in a Java program?
 Ans: Only one public class allowed for one file because JVM can find and run the program.

5. What is Data types? how many types of data types we used in Java and what are those?
 Ans: Data types what kind data can java hold or recognize in java we have two types of data types:

        * Non-Primitive data types
            * String

            * classes
