1.) Java is a high-level, object-oriented language.
    It is used to build wide range of applications including mobile apps,
    web applications etc.It is also used in cloud computing and big data processing.

2) JDK:- Java Development Kit
    => In this we can write , compile and debug the codes
    JRE :- Java RunTime Environment
    => It gives everything needed to run a Java program, including the JVM.
    JVM:- Java Virtual Machine
    =>It runs Java bytecode and makes Java programs work on any computer.

3) For writing a Java Code these are two main lines we want:-
    => public class (The filename we created)
    => public static void main(String[] args(){}
    For compiling, In terminal we need to give (javac)

4) Actually, you can have many classes, but only one class should have the main() method, because thatâ€™s where Java starts running the program.

5) Data types:- Data types tell Java what kind of data we are using.
    THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF DATA TYPES:-
    1) PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE
    2) NON-PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE
