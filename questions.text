Theory part:-
1) java is a programming language and it is a Compiler based Programming Language.. This is the most trustworthy language.

2) JDK:- Java Development Kit
=> In this we can write , compile and debug the codes
JRE :- Java RunTime Environment
=> It gives everything needed to run a Java program, including the JVM.
JVM:- Java Virtual Machine
=>It runs Java bytecode and makes Java programs work on any computer.

3) For writing a Java Code these are two main lines we want:-
=> public class (The filename we created)
=> public static void main(String[] args(){}
For compiling, In terminal we need to give (javac)

4)Actually, you can have many classes, but only one class should have the main() method, because thatâ€™s where Java starts running the program.

5)Data types:- Data types tell Java what kind of data we are using.
THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF DATA TYPES:-
1) PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE
2) NON-PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE
